BUILDING BLOCKS OF DJANGO REST FRAMEWORKS
1. Models : Tables of the database. 
2. urls: 
3. Serializers

Serialization: changing our model data to representations such as json

---set up a model called Article inside models.py
---register the rest_framework_app inside settings.py
--- create serializers.py file inside basic-web_api app.
--- from rest_framework import serializers
--- from .models import Article
--- define a serializer class. 
--- use modelserializer
--- inside views.py, we create function-based api views. 
-create urls.py file
-register the urls inside the main urls.py file. 


<!-- Decorators -->
- decorators are used for function based views. 
- they are added in views.py
- start by importing api_view from rest_framework.decorators.
- This is used to create django browsable APIs
